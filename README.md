Welcome to the ICBM Simulator repository! This project offers a 2D simulation of the Minuteman 3 Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) system developed using Unity and C#. The simulator provides users with an engaging experience of controlling and launching ICBMs.
(Note: The project was entirely made in french)

### Key Features:
- **Realistic Simulation:** Experience close-to-reality behavior of an ICBM, offering a realistic simulation environment.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Navigate and operate the ICBM system effortlessly with a user-friendly French control interface.
- **Real-Time Data:** Monitor velocity, altitude, and fuel levels in real-time throughout the simulation.
- **Diverse Launch Locations:** Launch missiles from various locations, each with a unique background setting.
- **Simulation Speed Control:** Speed up the simulation to condense real-life scenarios.
