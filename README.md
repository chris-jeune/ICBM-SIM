### ICBM Simulator

Welcome to the ICBM Simulator repository! This project is a 2D simulation of the Minuteman 3 Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) system developed using Unity and C#. The simulator provides users with a simple experience of controlling and launching ICBMs.

### Features:
- **Realistic Simulation:** Experience the realistic behavior of an ICBM. While we were not able to implement all the physics, it is a close representation of reality.
- **Control Interface:** Interact with a user-friendly control interface designed for easy navigation and operation of the ICBM system.
- **Real-time data:** Keep track of the real-time data of the ICBM, including the velocity, the altitude, and the fuel.
- **Different locations:** Launch your missile from different locations with a different background.
- **Speed-up simulation:** You can increase the speed of the simulation as real-life scenarios are especially long.

### Collaborator:
This project was developed in collaboration with Yan Hui—special thanks to Yan Hui for her contributions to the design and development of the ICBM Simulator.
